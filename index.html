              In 1945, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert designed a special
              machine called the ENIAC, or Electronic Numerical Integrator And
              Computer, to attempt to calculate ballistics trajectories faster
              than a team of human “computers.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Six women out of nearly 100 female mathematicians working for the
              government as computers were hired to perform calculations using
              the new machine. Jean Jennings Bartik, Frances Elizabeth “Betty”
              Holberton, Frances Bilas Spence, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Kathleen
              “Kay” McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, and Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum
              were not initially given the clearance necessary to enter the
              ENIAC room and instead were expected to code the machine based on
              paper diagrams.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the ENIAC’s public debut in 1946 the male inventors of the
              machine received awards and publicity while the female programmers
              received no recognition. Any photos of the women working with the
              machine did not include their names or roles.
            </p>

              Although women who performed other wartime jobs were expected to
              give the jobs up to men when they returned from the war, this
              wasn’t the case with programming. After all, men had never done it
              before.

              The computing boom that followed the war pulled in more men than
              women, but the percentages of women in programming were much
              higher than those in other STEM fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even with the introduction of men, programming was often conflated
              with low-level clerical work commonly performed by women like
              typing or filing.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1959, Grace Hopper developed the first programming language
              called COBOL. COBOL is still widely used today, especially by
              banks and governments. It runs on virtually any platform and is
              very adept with numbers. As such, it’s used in almost all business
              transactions. Every time you swipe a credit card or sell an
              investment security, COBOL is involved.

            <p>
              In the 1950s and 60s women were encouraged to work as programmers
              as seen in the 1967 Cosmopolitan feature “Computer Girls.” In the
              article, Grace Hopper said, “Programming requires patience and the
              ability to handle detail. Women are ‘naturals’ at computer
              programming.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1960s, big employers like the System Development
              Corporation (SDC) and IBM began to rely heavily on personality
              profiles and aptitude tests to hire programmers. The personality
              profiles of successful programmers, created by psychologists
              starting in the late 1960s, codified many of the stereotypes that
              abound today, like antisocialness.
            </p>
            <p>
              There was widespread evidence, even in the late 1960s, that
              psychometric testing was inaccurate, unscientific, and was a poor
              predictor of future performance, yet these methods continued to be
              used simply because they were convenient.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 1969, the median salary for female computer specialists was
              $7,763. In contrast, men earned a median of $11,193 as computer
              specialists.

            <h1>1980s</h1>
            <p>
              In 1985, women represented 37% of computer science bachelor’s
              degrees, an all time high.
            </p>
            <p>
              When personal computers started to become popular in the 1980s,
              the stereotype of the programmer as antisocial super-nerd was set,
              aided by the rise of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Films like
              <i>Weird Science</i>, <i>War Games</i>, and
              <i>Real Genius</i> perpetuated the stereotype. Personal computers
              were primarily marketed to boys.
            </p>
            <p>
              Families were far more likely to buy computers for boys than
              girls, and since college admissions officers expected computer
              science applicants to have experience with home computers, women
              were less likely to be accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the '70s, professors in intro classes assumed their students
              came in with no experience, but by the '80s, that had changed,
              putting women at a disadvantage.
