                <p>In 1959, Grace Hopper developed the first programming language

                  banks and governments. It runs on virtually any platform and is
                  very adept with numbers. As such, it’s used in almost all business
                  transactions. Every time you swipe a credit card or sell an
                  investment security, COBOL is involved.</p>

                as seen in the 1967 Cosmopolitan feature “Computer Girls.” In the
                article, Grace Hopper said, “Programming requires patience and the

                starting in the late 1960s, codified many of the stereotypes that
