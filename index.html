                the stereotype of the programmer as antisocial super-nerd was set,
                aided by the rise of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Films like
                <i>Weird Science</i>, <i>War Games</i>, and
                <i>Real Genius</i> perpetuated the stereotype. Personal computers
